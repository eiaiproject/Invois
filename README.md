# Invois

## Overview
Invois is a web application that enables users to create, manage, and export invoices directly from the browser. The application is built with React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Dexie for client‑side IndexedDB storage. PDF generation is handled by `@react-pdf/renderer`. All data is stored locally, making the application usable offline without a backend server.

## New Capabilities
- **Footnote Enforcement** – Every generated PDF now includes the mandatory footnote *"Barang yang sudah dibeli tidak dapat dikembalikan."* to clarify return policy.
- **Plain‑Text Export** – Users can copy a markdown representation of an invoice to the clipboard. This text can be pasted into chat applications or email clients, providing a lightweight alternative to PDF.
- **Improved UI** – The optional notes field no longer displays a placeholder, reducing visual noise.
- **Copy‑to‑Clipboard Button** – After an invoice is saved, a *Salin Teks* button appears alongside the PDF download button, invoking the markdown export.

## Features
- Create invoices with automatic line‑item calculations (subtotal, discount, tax, grand total).
- Store invoice history locally using IndexedDB with reactive Dexie hooks.
- Export invoices as PDF documents with a professional layout.
- Responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices.
- Settings page for logo upload and brand customization.
- Optional environment configuration for AI‑assisted suggestions via Gemini API.

## Architecture
- **src/pages** – React Router pages (`CreateInvoice`, `History`, `Catalog`, `Settings`).
- **src/components** – Reusable UI components, including `Layout` and `InvoicePDF`.
- **src/lib** – Utility functions (`utils.ts`) and Dexie database wrapper (`db.ts`).
- **src/App.tsx** – Application entry point with route definitions.
- **PDF Generation** – Implemented in `src/components/InvoicePDF.tsx` using `@react-pdf/renderer`.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
git clone https://github.com/eiaiproject/Invois.git
cd Invois

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file at the project root if you need to provide a Gemini API key for AI features:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
Additional environment variables can be added as required.

## Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
The development server runs on port 3000 by default. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to use the application.

## Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
The compiled assets are placed in the `dist/` directory and can be served with any static‑file server, for example:
```bash
npx serve -s dist
```

## PDF Generation
The `InvoicePDF` component generates a PDF that includes:
- Company branding (logo or brand name).
- Client and invoice details.
- Itemised table with description, quantity, unit price, and total.
- Subtotal, discount, tax, and grand total calculations.
- Payment method section (if configured).
- Mandatory footnote about non‑returnable items.

## Database Schema
The client‑side database is defined in `src/lib/db.ts` using Dexie:
- **invoices** – Stores invoice metadata, client information, dates, totals, and notes.
- **catalog** – Holds reusable product/service entries for quick selection.
Both tables are indexed for efficient queries, and Dexie React hooks keep the UI synchronized with the data.

## Utility Functions
- `formatCurrency` – Formats numbers as Indonesian Rupiah.
- `generateInvoiceNumber` – Generates sequential invoice numbers based on a prefix.
- `invoiceToMarkdown` – Converts an invoice and profile data into a markdown string that can be copied to the clipboard. This function is used by the *Salin Teks* button.
- `cn` – Utility for merging Tailwind class names.
